## Comments

- The `Inter` Google font weights are not consistent with Figma. This causes minor weight discrepancies in the final result.
- The Youtube embed was modified to use the videoId and start instead of the URL provided because the Hygraph URL type does not accept some special characters.
- Modified the logo to create a suitable favicon for the website.
